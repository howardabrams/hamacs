* Initialization Section
Org is an important part of my Emacs world, and with a lot of customization (even though Spacemacs and Doom do a good job getting things started).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-return-follows-link t
        org-startup-indented t
        ;; Speed Commands: If point is at the beginning of a headline or code
        ;; block in org-mode, single keys do fun things. See
        ;; org-speed-command-help for details (or hit the ? key at a headline).

Overcoming a bug:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-clocking-buffer (&rest ignored))
#+END_SRC
* Configuration Section
The following sections assume that org has been loaded, as this begin the configuration section:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
:config
#+END_SRC
I pretend that my org files are word processing files that wrap automatically:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
#+END_SRC
Files that end in =.txt= are still org files to me:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.txt\\'" . org-mode))
#+END_SRC
Many of the files that I edit close some, but not all, of the headers using a file variable. Let's allow that to not insist that I need to approve that:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'safe-local-variable-values '(org-content . 2))
#+END_SRC
** Better Return
Hitting the ~Return~ key in an org file should format the following line based on context. For instance, at the end of a list, insert a new item.
We begin with the interactive function that calls our code only if we are at the end of the line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ha/org-return ()
    "If at the end of a line, do something special based on the
   information about the line by calling `ha/org-special-return',
   otherwise, just call `org-return' as usual."
    (interactive)
    (if (eolp)
        (ha/org-special-return)
      (org-return)))
#+END_SRC

And bind it to the Return key:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "RET")  #'ha/org-return)
#+END_SRC

What should we do if we are at the end of a line?
 - Given a prefix, call =org-return= as usual in an org file.
 - On a link, call =org-return= in order to open it.
 - On a header? Let's create a new header (or maybe not).
 - In a table? Let's create a new row.
 - If we are really in a list, we can create a new item.

I really should break this function into smaller bits ...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ha/org-special-return (&optional ignore)
    "Add new list item, heading or table row with RET.
  A double return on an empty element deletes it.
  Use a prefix arg to get regular RET."
    (interactive "P")
    (if ignore
        (org-return)
      (cond
       ;; Open links like usual
       ((eq 'link (car (org-element-context)))
        (org-return))

       ((and (org-really-in-item-p) (not (bolp)))
        (if (org-element-property :contents-begin (org-line-element-context))
            (progn
              (end-of-line)
              (org-insert-item))
          (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))))

       ;; ((org-at-heading-p)
       ;;  (if (string= "" (org-element-property :title (org-element-context)))
       ;;      (delete-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))
       ;;    (org-insert-heading-after-current)))

       ((org-at-table-p)
        (if (-any?
             (lambda (x) (not (string= "" x)))
             (nth
              (- (org-table-current-dline) 1)
              (org-table-to-lisp)))
            (org-return)
          ;; empty row
          (beginning-of-line)
          (setf (buffer-substring
          (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position)) "")
          (org-return)))

       (t
        (org-return)))))
#+END_SRC

How do we know if we are in a list item? Lists end with two blank lines, so we need to make sure we are also not at the beginning of a line to avoid a loop where a new entry gets created with only one blank line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-really-in-item-p ()
  "Similar to `org-in-item-p', however, this works around an
issue where the point could actually be in some =code= words, but
still be on an item element."
  (save-excursion
    (let ((location (org-element-property :contents-begin (org-line-element-context))))
      (when location
        (goto-char location))
      (org-in-item-p))))
#+END_SRC

The org API allows getting the context associated with /current element/. However, this could be a line-level symbol, like paragraph or =list-item= only if the point isn't /inside/ a bold or italics item. You know how HTML distinguishes between /block/ and /inline/ elements, org doesn't. So, let's make a function that makes that distinction:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-line-element-context ()
  "Return the symbol of the current block element, e.g. paragraph or list-item."
  (let ((context (org-element-context)))
    (while (member (car context) '(verbatim code bold italic underline))
      (setq context (org-element-property :parent context)))
    context))
#+END_SRC
** Tasks
I need to add a /blocked/ state:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t)" "DOING(g)" "|" "DONE(d)" )
                          (sequence "BLOCKED(b)" "|" "CANCELLED(c)")))
#+END_SRC

And I would like to have cute little icons for those states:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dolist (m '(org-mode org-journal-mode))
  (font-lock-add-keywords m                        ; A bit silly but my headers are now
                          `(("^\\*+ \\(TODO\\) "   ; shorter, and that is nice canceled
                             (1 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "⚑") nil)))
                            ("^\\*+ \\(DOING\\) "
                             (1 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "⚐") nil)))
                            ("^\\*+ \\(CANCELED\\) "
                             (1 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "✘") nil)))
                            ("^\\*+ \\(BLOCKED\\) "
                             (1 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "✋") nil)))
                            ("^\\*+ \\(DONE\\) "
                             (1 (progn (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "✔") nil)))
                            ;; Here is my approach for quickly making the
                            ;; initial asterisks for listing items and whatnot,
                            ;; appear as Unicode bullets (without actually
                            ;; affecting the text file or the behavior).
                            ("^ +\\([-*]\\) "
                             (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•")))))))
#+END_SRC

** Meetings
I've notice that while I really like taking notes in a meeting, I don't always like the multiple windows I have opened, so I created this function that I can easily call to eliminate distractions during a meeting.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun meeting-notes ()
    "Call this after creating an org-mode heading for where the notes for the meeting
     should be. After calling this function, call 'meeting-done' to reset the environment."
      (interactive)
      (outline-mark-subtree)                             ; Select org-mode section
      (narrow-to-region (region-beginning) (region-end)) ; Only show that region
      (deactivate-mark)
      (delete-other-windows)                             ; remove other windows
      (text-scale-set 2)                                 ; readable by others
      (fringe-mode 0)
      (message "When finished taking your notes, run meeting-done."))
#+END_SRC

Of course, I need an 'undo' feature when the meeting is over...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun meeting-done ()
      "Attempt to 'undo' the effects of taking meeting notes."
      (interactive)
      (widen)                    ; Opposite of narrow-to-region
      (text-scale-set 0)         ; Reset the font size increase
      (fringe-mode 1)
      (winner-undo))             ; Put the windows back in place
#+END_SRC
** Misc
*** Babel Blocks
Whenever I edit Emacs Lisp blocks from my tangle-able configuration files, I get a lot of superfluous warnings. Let's turn them off.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun disable-flycheck-in-org-src-block ()
  (setq-local flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc)))

(add-hook 'org-src-mode-hook 'disable-flycheck-in-org-src-block)
#+END_SRC
And turn on ALL the languages:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages
                               '((shell      . t)
                                 (js         . t)
                                 (emacs-lisp . t)
                                 (clojure    . t)
                                 (python     . t)
                                 (ruby       . t)
                                 (dot        . t)
                                 (css        . t)
                                 (plantuml   . t)))

#+END_SRC
*** Next Image
When I create images or other artifacts that I consider /part/ of the org document, I want to have them based on the org file, but with a prepended number. Keeping track of what numbers are now free is difficult, so for a /default/ let's figure it out:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ha/org-next-image-number (&optional prefix)
  (when (null prefix)
    (if (null (buffer-file-name))
        (setq prefix "cool-image")
      (setq prefix (file-name-base (buffer-file-name)))))

  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((largest 0)
          (png-reg (rx (literal prefix) "-" (group (one-or-more digit)) (or ".png" ".svg"))))
      (while (re-search-forward png-reg nil t)
        (setq largest (max largest (string-to-number (match-string-no-properties 1)))))
      (format "%s-%02d" prefix (1+ largest)))))
#+END_SRC
*** In a PlantUML Block
To make the snippets more context aware, this predicate

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ha/org-nested-in-plantuml-block ()
  "Predicate is true if point is inside a Plantuml Source code block in org-mode."
  (equal "plantuml"
         (plist-get (cadr (org-element-at-point)) :language)))
#+END_SRC
** Keybindings
Bindings specific to org files:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (general-evil-define-key 'normal org-mode-map
    :prefix "SPC m"
      "e" '("exports" . org-export-dispatch)
      "y" '("insert link" . org-insert-link)

      "n"  '(:ignore t :which-key "narrow")
      "n s" '("subtree" . org-narrow-to-subtree)
      "n b" '("block" . org-narrow-to-block)
      "n e" '("element" . org-narrow-to-element)
      "n w" '("widen" . widen))
#+END_SRC
* Supporting Packages
At this point, we assume that the =use-package= for org is complete, so we can close it and allow other projects to be loaded:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
)
#+END_SRC
** Exporters
Need a few extra exporters:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (use-package ox-md
    :straight nil)

  (use-package ox-confluence
    :straight nil
    :load-path "~/.doom.d/elisp")
#+END_SRC

And Graphviz configuration using [[https://github.com/ppareit/graphviz-dot-mode][graphviz-dot-mode]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package graphviz-dot-mode
    :mode "\\.dot\\'"
    :init
    (setq tab-width 4
          graphviz-dot-indent-width 2
          graphviz-dot-auto-indent-on-newline t
          graphviz-dot-auto-indent-on-braces t
          graphviz-dot-auto-indent-on-semi t))
#+END_SRC
And we can install company support:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(use-package company-graphviz-dot)
#+END_SRC
** Writegood

The [[https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode][writegood-mode]] highlights passive and weasel words as typed. Shame it doesn't check for dangled prepositions.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package writegood-mode
    :hook ((org-mode . writegood-mode)))
#+END_SRC
* Technical Artifacts                                :noexport:

Let's provide a name so that the file can be required:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
(provide 'ha-org)
;;; ha-org.el ends here
#+END_SRC
