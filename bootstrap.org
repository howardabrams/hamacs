* Introduction
This file contains all the variable definitions and library loading for the other files in my project.
** Straight Package Installer
I'm going to be installing everything using the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#getting-started][straight.el]] for package installation and management. Here is the initialization/installation for it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (bootstrap-version 5))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
#+END_SRC
Let's get the Straight project working with =use-package=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'use-package)
#+END_SRC
While that enables the =:straight t= extension to =use-package=, let's just have that be the default:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package straight
  :custom (straight-use-package-by-default t))
#+END_SRC
See the details in [[https://dev.to/jkreeftmeijer/emacs-package-management-with-straight-el-and-use-package-3oc8][this essay]].
** Basic Libraries
The following packages come with Emacs, but seems like they still need loading:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'subr-x)
#+END_SRC
Ugh. Why am I getting this error?
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun first (elt) (car elt))
#+END_SRC
While most libraries will take care of their dependencies, I want to install /my dependent libraries/. Especially, [[https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d/][Magnar Sveen]]'s Clojure-inspired [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]] project:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package dash)
#+END_SRC

The [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s.el]] project is a simpler string manipulation library that I (and other projects) use:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package s)
#+END_SRC

Manipulate file paths with the [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f.el]] project:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package f)
#+END_SRC
** My Code Location
Much of my more complicated code comes from my website essays and other projects. The destination, however, shows up here:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (f-expand "~/.emacs.d/elisp"))
#+END_SRC

Hopefully, this will tie me over while I transition.
** Emacs Server Control
Sure the Emacs application will almost always have the =server-start= going, however, I need to control it just a bit (because I often have two instances running on some of my machines). What /defines/ the Emacs instance for work changes ... often:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ha-emacs-for-work? ()
  "Return non-nil when the Emacs application's location matches as one for work.
Currently, this is the `emacs-plus' app that I have built with
the native-comp model, but I reserve the right to change this."
  (->> Info-default-directory-list
    (first)
    (s-split "/")
    (--filter (s-starts-with? "emacs-plus" it))
    (first)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (ha-emacs-for-work?)
    (setq server-name "work")
  (setq server-name "personal"))

(server-start)
#+END_SRC
* Load the Rest
The following loads the rest of my org-mode literate files. I add them as they are /ready/, but eventually, I'll trim this up into a nicer pattern.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (dolist (file `("ha-config.org"
                  "ha-display.org"
                  "ha-org.org"
                  "ha-org-word-processor.org"
                  "ha-org-clipboard.org"
                  ;; "org-journaling.org"
                  ;; "org-publishing.org"
                  "ha-org-sprint.org"
                  "ha-capturing-notes.org"
                  "ha-programming.org"
                  ;; "ha-agendas.org"
                  ;; "ha-email.org"
                  ;; "ha-irc.org"
                  ;; "ha-passwords.org"
                  ;; "ha-remoting.org"
                  ;; "my-feeds.org"
                  ,(when (ha-emacs-for-work?)
                     "ha-work.org")))
    (org-babel-load-file (f-join hamacs-source-dir file)))
#+END_SRC
We can test/debug any individual file, via:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (org-babel-load-file (f-join hamacs-source-dir "ha-org-word-processor.org"))
#+END_SRC
* Technical Artifacts :noexport:
Let's provide a name so that the file can be required:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
(provide 'bootstrap)
;;; bootstrap.el ends here
#+END_SRC

Before you can build this on a new system, make sure that you put the cursor over any of these properties, and hit: ~C-c C-c~
