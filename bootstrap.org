* Introduction
This file contains all the variable definitions and library loading for the other files in my project.
** Straight Package Installer
I'm going to be installing everything using the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#getting-started][straight.el]] for package installation and management. However, before I could tangle these org files, I needed to have =straight= grab the latest =org=, so the following initialization code is actually in [[file:initialize][initialize]], but the good stuff is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (defvar bootstrap-version)

  (let ((bootstrap-file
	 (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
	(bootstrap-version 5))
    (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
      (with-current-buffer
	  (url-retrieve-synchronously
	   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
	   'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
	(goto-char (point-max))
	(eval-print-last-sexp)))
    (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
#+END_SRC
Let's get the Straight project working with =use-package=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(straight-use-package 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

While that enables the =:straight t= extension to =use-package=, let's just have that be the default:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(use-package straight
  :custom (straight-use-package-by-default t
           straight-default-vc 'git))
#+END_SRC
See the details in [[https://dev.to/jkreeftmeijer/emacs-package-management-with-straight-el-and-use-package-3oc8][this essay]].

** OS Path and Native Compilation
Helper functions to allow code for specific operating systems:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-running-on-macos? ()
    "Return non-nil if running on Mac OS systems."
    (equal system-type 'darwin))

  (defun ha-running-on-linux? ()
    "Return non-nil if running on Linux systems."
    (equal system-type 'gnu/linux))
#+END_SRC

With the way I start Emacs, I may not have the PATH I /actually/ use (from the shell) available, so we'll force it (code taken [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ExecPath][from here]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun set-exec-path-from-shell ()
    "Set up Emacs' `exec-path' and PATH environment variable to match
  that used by the user's shell.

  This is particularly useful under Mac OS X and macOS, where GUI
  apps are not started from a shell."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((path-from-shell (shell-command-to-string "echo $PATH"))
           (trimmed-path    (replace-regexp-in-string (rx (zero-or-more space) eol)
                                                      "" path-from-shell))
           (in-fish?        (string-match (rx "fish" eol)
                                          (shell-command-to-string "echo $SHELL")))
           (separator       (if in-fish? " " ":"))
           (env-path        (if in-fish? (replace-regexp-in-string " " ":" trimmed-path) trimmed-path)))
      (message "PATH=%s" path-from-shell)
      (setenv "PATH" env-path)
      (setq exec-path (split-string trimmed-path separator))))
#+END_SRC

Clear up a Mac-specific issue that sometimes arises since I'm switching to [[http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][native compilation project]], as the =Emacs.app= that I use doesn't have its =bin= directory, e.g. =Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (ha-running-on-macos?)
      (add-to-list 'exec-path "/usr/local/bin")
      (add-to-list 'exec-path (concat invocation-directory "bin") t))
#+END_SRC

Getting tired off all the packages that I load spewing a bunch of warnings that I can't do anything about:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (and (fboundp 'native-comp-available-p)
             (native-comp-available-p))
    (setq native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors nil
          native-comp-deferred-compilation t))
#+END_SRC
** GNU Pretty Good Privacy
On Linux, GPG is pretty straight-forward, but on the Mac, I often have troubles doing:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install gpg
#+END_SRC
And I need to install the [[https://gpgtools.org/][GPG Suite]]. While very nice, isn't a GUI I really need, but can take advantage when installed:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun executable (path)
    "Return PATH if it is executable, see `file-executable-p'."
    (when (file-executable-p path) path))

  (use-package epa-file
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :custom (epg-gpg-program (or (executable "/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg")
                                 (executable "/usr/local/bin/gpg")
                                 (executable "/usr/local/opt/gpg")
                                 (executable "/usr/bin/pgp")))
    :config (epa-file-enable))
#+END_SRC
** Basic Libraries
The following packages come with Emacs, but seems like they still need loading:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package cl-lib
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :init (defun first (elt) (car elt))
    :commands (first))

  (require 'subr-x)
#+END_SRC
Ugh. Why am I getting a missing =first= function error? I define a simple implementation, that the CL library will overwrite ... at some point.

While most libraries will take care of their dependencies, I want to install /my dependent libraries/. Especially, [[https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d/][Magnar Sveen]]'s Clojure-inspired [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]] project:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package dash)
#+END_SRC
Sure this package is essentially syntactic sugar, and to help /share/ my configuration, I attempt to use =thread-last= instead of =->>=, but, I still like it.

The [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s.el]] project is a simpler string manipulation library that I (and other projects) use:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package s)
#+END_SRC

Manipulate file paths with the [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f.el]] project:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package f)
#+END_SRC
** My Code Location
Much of my more complicated code comes from my website essays and other projects. The destination, however, shows up here:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (f-expand "~/.emacs.d/elisp"))
#+END_SRC

Hopefully, this will tie me over while I transition.
** Emacs Server Control
Sure the Emacs application will almost always have the =server-start= going, however, I need to control it just a bit (because I often have two instances running on some of my machines). What /defines/ the Emacs instance for work changes ... often:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-emacs-for-work? ()
    "Return non-nil when the Emacs application's location matches as one for work.
  Currently, this is the `emacs-plus@28' app that I have built with
  the native-comp model, but I reserve the right to change this."
    (and (f-dir? "~/work")
         (string-match "emacs-plus@28" exec-directory)))
#+END_SRC

And now start the server with an appropriate tag name:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (not (ha-emacs-for-work?))
      (setq server-name "personal")
    (setq server-name "work")
    (when (ha-running-on-macos?)
      (set-exec-path-from-shell)))

  (server-start)
#+END_SRC
* Load the Rest
The following loads the rest of my org-mode literate files. I add them as they are /ready/, but eventually, I'll trim this up into a nicer pattern.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar ha-hamacs-files (flatten-list `("ha-private.org"
                            "ha-config.org"
                            ,(when (display-graphic-p)
                               "ha-display.org")
                            "ha-org.org"
                            ,(when (display-graphic-p)
                               "ha-org-word-processor.org")
                            "ha-org-clipboard.org"
                            "ha-capturing-notes.org"
                            "ha-agendas.org"
                            "ha-passwords.org"
                            "ha-remoting.org"
                            "ha-programming.org"
                            "ha-programming-python.org"
                            ,(if (ha-emacs-for-work?)
                                 '("ha-org-sprint.org" "ha-work.org")
                               ;; Personal Editor
                               '("ha-org-journaling.org"
                                 "ha-irc.org"
                                 "ha-org-publishing.org"
                                 "ha-email.org"
                                 "ha-programming-scheme.org"
                                 "ha-aux-apps.org"
                                 "ha-feed-reader.org"))))
    "List of org files that complete the hamacs project.")
#+END_SRC

We can test/debug/reload any individual file, via:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-hamacs-load (file)
    "Load or reload an org-mode FILE containing literate Emacs configuration code."
    (interactive (list (completing-read "Org file: " ha-hamacs-files)))
    (let ((full-file (f-join hamacs-source-dir file)))
      (when (f-exists? full-file)
        (org-babel-load-file full-file))))
#+END_SRC

And we can now load everything:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-hamacs-reload-all ()
    "Reload our entire ecosystem of configuration files."
    (interactive)
    (dolist (file ha-hamacs-files)
      (ha-hamacs-load file)))
#+END_SRC

And do it:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (ha-hamacs-reload-all)
#+END_SRC

Once we have loaded /my world/, letâs add every other Org file in the project to the list, so that I can easily bring more stuff.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ha-hamacs-files
        (-uniq
         (append ha-hamacs-files
                 (directory-files "~/other/hamacs" nil (rx ".org" eos)))))
#+END_SRC
* Technical Artifacts :noexport:
Let's provide a name so that the file can be required:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports none
(provide 'bootstrap)
;;; bootstrap.el ends here
#+END_SRC
