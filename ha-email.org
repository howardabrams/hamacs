#+end_src
* Introduction
To use this system, begin with ~SPC a M~ (after a ~SPC a n~ to asychronously download new mail … which probably should be running beforehand).

When the Notmuch interface up, hit ~J~ to jump to one of the Search boxes (described below). Typically, this is ~i~ for the Imbox, check out the focused message from people I care). Hit ~q~ to return.

Next type ~s~ to view and organize mail I've never seen before. We need to focus the display, so /creating auto filtering rules/ is important. Move the point to the message and hit one of the following to automatically move the sender to a pre-defined box:

  - ~I~ :: screened email important enough to go to my Imbox
  - ~S~ :: spam … so much goes here
  - ~P~ :: receipts go to this *Paper Trail*, which takes a *tag* as the name of the store
  - ~f~ :: mailing lists and other email that might be nice to read go to *The Feed*

** Email Addresses
The configuration files below expect email addresses (I store passwords and other encrypted information elsewhere).  These email addresses are /not/ private, but I figured I would annoy any screenscraping spam-inducing crawlers out there, while still allowing others to follow my lead on configuring Emacs and Email.

#+name: email-address-1
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports none :tangle no :results silent
  (rot13-string "ubjneq@ubjneqnoenzf.pbz")
#+end_src

#+name: email-address-2
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports none :tangle no :results silent
  (rot13-string "ubjneq.noenzf@tznvy.pbz")
#+end_src

#+name: email-address-3
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports none :tangle no :results silent
  (rot13-string "ubjneq@shmmlgbnfg.pbz")
#+end_src

To use these, we set the =:noweb yes= (to pull in the /name/ of the code block) but put a pair of parens after the name to have it evaluated. For instance, the configuration for sending mail through the MUA in Emacs:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
  (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
        message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
        smtpmail-starttls-credentials '(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 nil nil))
        smtpmail-auth-credentials `(("smtp.gmail.com" 587 ,<<email-address-1>> nil))
        smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
        smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
        smtpmail-smtp-service 587)
#+end_src
* Installation and Basic Configuration
To begin, we need the code. On Ubuntu, this is:
#+begin_src shell :tangle no
  sudo apt install -y notmuch
#+end_src

And on MacOS, we use =brew=:
#+begin_src shell :tangle no
  brew install notmuch
#+end_src

Next, we need some basic configuration settings and some global keybindings:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
  (use-package notmuch
    :init
    (setq mail-user-agent 'notmuch-user-agent

          notmuch-mail-dir (format "%s/%s" (getenv "HOME") ".mail")
          notmuch-hooks-dir (expand-file-name ".notmuch/hooks" notmuch-mail-dir)

          notmuch-show-logo nil
          notmuch-message-deleted-tags '("+deleted" "-inbox" "-unread")
          notmuch-archive-tags '("-inbox" "-unread" "+archived")
          notmuch-show-mark-read-tags '("-inbox" "-unread" "+archived")
          notmuch-search-oldest-first nil
          notmuch-show-indent-content nil)

    :bind (:map notmuch-hello-mode-map
                ("U" . notmuch-retrieve-messages)
                ("C" . notmuch-mua-new-mail)
           :map notmuch-tree-mode-map
                ("C" . notmuch-mua-new-mail)))
#+end_src

And some leader-based keybindings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
  (use-package notmuch
    :config
    (ha-leader   ; Should I put these under an "m" heading?
      "a n" '("new mail" . notmuch-retrieve-messages)
      "a c" '("compose mail" . compose-mail))

    (major-mode-hydra-define notmuch-hello-mode (:quit-key "q")
      ("Mail"
       (("u" notmuch-retrieve-messages "new mail")
        ("m" notmuch "read mail"))
       "Messages"
       (("c" notmuch-mua-new-mail "compose")
        ("C" hey-notmuch-reply-later "reply-later")))))
#+end_src

Also, let's do some basic configuration of Emacs' mail system:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq mm-text-html-renderer 'shr
        mail-specify-envelope-from t
        message-kill-buffer-on-exit t
        message-send-mail-function 'message-send-mail-with-sendmail
        message-sendmail-envelope-from 'header)
#+end_src

Create a special mail perspective:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ha-leader "a M" `("mail" . ,(ha-app-perspective "mail" #'notmuch)))
#+end_src
* Configuration
Do I want to sign messages by default? Nope.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'mml-secure-sign-pgpmime)
#+end_src
** Addresses
I need to incorporate an address book again, but in the meantime, searching through a history of past email works well enough.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package notmuch
    :config
    (setq notmuch-address-selection-function
          (lambda (prompt collection initial-input)
            (completing-read prompt
                             (cons initial-input collection)
                             nil
                             t
                             nil
                             'notmuch-address-history))))
#+end_src
** Sending Messages
Do I need to set up [[https://marlam.de/msmtp/][MSMTP]]? No, as Notmuch will do that work.
To do this, type ~c~ and select an option (including ~r~ to reply).

** Retrieving Messages
When we start notmuch, we need to retrieve the email and then process it. Most of this is actually contained in the Notmuch configuration.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun notmuch-retrieve-messages ()
    "Retrieve and process my mail messages."
    (interactive)
    (async-shell-command "notmuch new"))
#+end_src
* iSync Configuration
Using [[https://isync.sourceforge.io/][isync]] (or is it =mbsync=) for mail retrieval. I have a couple of Google Mail accounts that I want connected.

There are global settings:
#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.mbsyncrc :noweb yes
  # Note: We now tangle this file from ~/src/hamacs/ha-email.org
  Create Both
  SyncState *
  MaxMessages 100
  Sync All # New ReNew Flags
#+end_src

The following section is for my /personal/ (not too general) account.
The file generally can have a =Pass= entry for the encrypted passcode, but to show how to connect to more than one accounts, I'm using a GPG daemon:

#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.mbsyncrc :noweb yes
  # PERSONAL ACCOUNT
  IMAPAccount personal
  Host imap.gmail.com
  User <<email-address-1()>>  # Substitute your own email address here
  PassCmd "gpg --quiet --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty --decrypt ~/.mailpass-personal.gpg"
  SSLType IMAPS
  AuthMechs LOGIN

  IMAPStore personal-remote
  Account personal

  MaildirStore personal-local
  Path ~/.mail/personal/
  Inbox ~/.mail/personal/INBOX
  Flatten .

  Channel personal-inbox
  Far :personal-remote:
  Near :personal-local:
  Patterns * !"[Gmail]/Drafts" !"[Gmail]/Spam"
  Expunge Both
  # Patterns "inbox"
  # ExpireUnread no

  Channel personal-sent
  Far :personal-remote:"[Gmail]/Sent Mail"
  Near :personal-local:sent
  ExpireUnread yes

  Channel personal-trash
  Far :personal-remote:"[Gmail]/Trash"
  Near :personal-local:trash
  ExpireUnread yes
#+end_src

I have other email accounts that could use or ignore.
#+begin_src conf :tangle no
  # GMAIL ACCOUNT
  IMAPAccount gmail
  Host imap.gmail.com
  User <<email-address-2()>>  # Substitute your own email address here
  PassCmd "gpg -q --for-your-eyes-only --pinentry-mode loopback -d ~/.mailpass-google.gpg"
  SSLType IMAPS
  AuthMechs LOGIN

  IMAPStore gmail-remote
  Account gmail

  MaildirStore gmail-local
  Path ~/.mail/gmail/
  Inbox ~/.mail/gmail/INBOX
  Flatten .

  Channel gmail-inbox
  Master :gmail-remote:
  Slave :gmail-local:
  Patterns * !"[Gmail]/Drafts" !"[Gmail]/Spam"
  Expunge Both
  # Patterns "inbox"

  Channel gmail-sent
  Master :gmail-remote:"[Gmail]/Sent Mail"
  Slave :gmail-local:sent
  ExpireUnread yes

  Channel gmail-trash
  Master :gmail-remote:"[Gmail]/Trash"
  Slave :gmail-local:trash
  ExpireUnread yes
#+end_src

* Notmuch Configuration
Notmuch requires these configuration files.
** =notmuch-config=
The general settings file that goes into =~/.notmuch-config=:

#+begin_src conf-unix :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
# .notmuch-config - Configuration file for the notmuch mail system
# Note: We now tangle this file from ~/src/hamacs/ha-email.org
#
# For more information about notmuch, see https://notmuchmail.org
#+end_src

The commentary for each of the subsections came from their man page.
*** Database configuration
The value supported here is =path= which should be the top-level directory where your mail exists and to where =mbsync= will new mail. Files should be individual email messages. Notmuch will store its database within a sub-directory of the path configured here named ".notmuch".

#+begin_src conf-unix :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
[database]
path=.mail
#+end_src
*** User configuration
Here is where you can let notmuch know how you address emails. Valid settings are
 - =name= :: Your full name.
 - =primary_email= :: Your primary email address.
 - =other_email= :: A list (separated by =;=) of other email addresses at which you receive email.

Notmuch use the email addresses configured here when formatting replies. It will avoid including your own addresses in the recipient list of replies, and will set the From address based on the address in the original email.

#+begin_src conf-unix :tangle ~/.notmuch-config :noweb yes
  [user]
  name=Howard Abrams
  primary_email=<<email-address-1()>>
  other_email=<<email-address-2()>>;<<email-address-3()>>
#+end_src
*NB:* In the configuration above, you may see the addresses are all set to =nil=. If you are copying this from a rendered web page, note that you need to substitute that with your own email address.
*** Configuration for "notmuch new"
Note the following supported options:
 - =tags= :: A list (separated by =;=) of the tags that added to all messages incorporated by "notmuch new".
 - =ignore= :: A list (separated by =;=) of file and directory names that will not be searched for messages by "notmuch new".

NOTE: *Every* file/directory that goes by one of those names will be ignored, independent of its depth/location in the mail store.
#+begin_src conf-unix :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
  [new]
  tags=unread;inbox;
  ignore=
#+end_src
*** Search configuration
The following option is supported here:

 - =exclude_tags= :: A ;-separated list of tags that will be excluded from search results by default.  Using an excluded tag in a query will override that exclusion.

#+begin_src conf-unix :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
  [search]
  exclude_tags=deleted;spam;
#+end_src
*** Maildir compatibility configuration
The following option is supported here:

 - =synchronize_flags= :: Valid values are true and false. If true, then the following maildir flags (in message filenames) will be synchronized with the corresponding notmuch tags:

   | Flag | Tag                                         |
   |------+---------------------------------------------|
   | D    | draft                                       |
   | F    | flagged                                     |
   | P    | passed                                      |
   | R    | replied                                     |
   | S    | unread (added when 'S' flag is not present) |

The =notmuch new= command will notice flag changes in filenames and update tags, while the =notmuch tag= and =notmuch restore= commands will notice tag changes and update flags in filenames.

#+begin_src conf-unix :tangle ~/.notmuch-config
  [maildir]
  synchronize_flags=true
#+end_src

That should complete the Notmuch configuration.
** =pre-new=
Then we need a shell script called when beginning a retrieval, =pre-new= that simply calls =mbsync= to download all the messages:

#+begin_src shell :tangle ~/.mail/.notmuch/hooks/pre-new :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
  # More info about hooks: https://notmuchmail.org/manpages/notmuch-hooks-5/
  # Note: We now tangle this file from ~/src/hamacs/ha-email.org

  echo "Starting not-much 'pre-new' script"

  mbsync -a

  echo "Completing not-much 'pre-new' script"
#+end_src
** =post-new=
And a =post-new= hook based on a filtering scheme that mimics the Hey.com workflow taken from [[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/frozencemetery/5042526/raw/57195ba748e336de80c27519fe66e428e5003ab8/post-new][this gist]] (note we have more to say on that later on) to filter and tag all messages after they have arrived:

#+begin_src shell :tangle ~/.mail/.notmuch/hooks/post-new :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
# Based On: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/frozencemetery/5042526/raw/57195ba748e336de80c27519fe66e428e5003ab8/post-new
# Note: We now tangle this file from ~/src/hamacs/ha-email.org
#
# Install this by moving this file to <maildir>/.notmuch/hooks/post-new
# NOTE: you need to define your maildir in the vardiable nm_maildir (just a few lines below in this script)
# Also create empty files for:
# 1. thefeed.db (things you want to read every once in a while)
# 2. spam.db (things you never want to see)
# 3. screened.db (your inbox)
# 4. ledger.db (papertrail)
# in the hooks folder.
# More info about hooks: https://notmuchmail.org/manpages/notmuch-hooks-5/

# Note:
#    Old emails:  notmuch search --output summary NOT date:30d.. and tag:unread
#    Ignore old emails: notmuch tag -unread --output summary NOT date:30d.. and tag:unread

* Hey
I originally took the following configuration from [[https://youtu.be/wuSPssykPtE][Vedang Manerikar's video]], along with [[https://gist.github.com/vedang/26a94c459c46e45bc3a9ec935457c80f][the code]]. The ideas brought out were to mimic the hey.com email workflow, and while not bad, I thought that maybe I could improve upon it slowly over time.

To allow me to keep Vedang's and my code side-by-side in the same Emacs variable state, I have renamed the prefix to =hey-=, however, if you are looking to steal my code, you may want to revisit the source.
** Default Searches

A list of pre-defined searches act like "Folder buttons" at the top to quickly see files that match those /buckets/:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Helper Functions

With good bucket definitions, we should be able to scan the mail quickly and deal with the entire lot of them:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun hey-notmuch-archive-all ()
    "Archive all the emails in the current view."
    (interactive)
    (notmuch-search-archive-thread nil (point-min) (point-max)))

  (defun hey-notmuch-delete-all ()
    "Archive all the emails in the current view.
  Mark them for deletion by cron job."
    (interactive)
    (notmuch-search-tag-all '("+deleted"))
    (hey-notmuch-archive-all))

  (defun hey-notmuch-search-delete-and-archive-thread ()
    "Archive the currently selected thread. Add the deleted tag as well."
    (interactive)
    (notmuch-search-add-tag '("+deleted"))
    (notmuch-search-archive-thread))

  (defun hey-notmuch-tag-and-archive (tag-changes &optional beg end)
    "Prompt the user for TAG-CHANGES.
  Apply the TAG-CHANGES to region and also archive all the emails.
  When called directly, BEG and END provide the region."
    (interactive (notmuch-search-interactive-tag-changes))
    (notmuch-search-tag tag-changes beg end)
    (notmuch-search-archive-thread nil beg end))
#+end_src

A key point in organizing emails with the Hey model, is looking at the "from" address:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun hey-notmuch-search-find-from ()
  "A helper function to find the email address for the given email."
  (let ((notmuch-addr-sexp (first
                            (notmuch-call-notmuch-sexp "address"
                                                       "--format=sexp"
                                                       "--format-version=1"
                                                       "--output=sender"
                                                       (notmuch-search-find-thread-id)))))
    (plist-get notmuch-addr-sexp :address)))
#+end_src

And we can create a filter, /search/ and tagging based on this "from" function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun hey-notmuch-filter-by-from ()
  "Filter the current search view to show all emails sent from the sender of the current thread."
  (interactive)
  (notmuch-search-filter (concat "from:" (hey-notmuch-search-find-from))))

(defun hey-notmuch-search-by-from (&optional no-display)
  "Show all emails sent from the sender of the current thread.
NO-DISPLAY is sent forward to `notmuch-search'."
  (interactive)
  (notmuch-search (concat "from:" (hey-notmuch-search-find-from))
                  notmuch-search-oldest-first nil nil no-display))

(defun hey-notmuch-tag-by-from (tag-changes &optional beg end refresh)
  "Apply TAG-CHANGES to all emails from the sender of the current thread.
BEG and END provide the region, but are ignored. They are defined
since `notmuch-search-interactive-tag-changes' returns them. If
REFRESH is true, refresh the buffer from which we started the
search."
  (interactive (notmuch-search-interactive-tag-changes))
  (let ((this-buf (current-buffer)))
    (hey-notmuch-search-by-from t)
    ;; This is a dirty hack since I can't find a way to run a
    ;; temporary hook on `notmuch-search' completion. So instead of
    ;; waiting on the search to complete in the background and then
    ;; making tag-changes on it, I will just sleep for a short amount
    ;; of time. This is generally good enough and works, but is not
    ;; guaranteed to work every time. I'm fine with this.
    (sleep-for 0.5)
    (notmuch-search-tag-all tag-changes)
    (when refresh
      (set-buffer this-buf)
      (notmuch-refresh-this-buffer))))
#+end_src

** Moving Mail to Buckets

We based the Hey buckets on notmuch databases, we combine the =hey-notmuch-add-addr-to-db= with the =hey-notmuch-tag-by-from= functions to move messages.

** Org Integration
The gods ordained that Mail and Org should dance together, so step one is composing mail with org:

A new option is to use [[https://github.com/jeremy-compostella/org-msg][org-msg]], so let's try it:

The idea of linking org documents to email could be nice, however, the =ol-notmuch= package in the [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/org-contrib.html][org-contrib]] package needs a maintainer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (use-package ol-notmuch
    :after org
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :config (add-to-list 'org-modules 'ol-notmuch))
#+end_src
To use, read a message and save a link to it with ~SPC o l~. Next, in an org document, create a link with ~, l~. Now, you can return to the message from that document with ~, o~.  Regardless, I may need to store a local copy when I upgrade Org.
