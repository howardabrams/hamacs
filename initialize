;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is my Emacs Bootloader. Simply put, I initialize the package management
;; system, and then tangle my literate files. This simple idea came from
;; https://github.com/susamn/dotfiles
;;
;;; Code:

;; We'll be using straight. So, we don't want duplicated package loading:
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; While I would rather program my configurations, sometimes the Emacs
;; menu system is “good enough”, but I want it in its own file:

(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))

;; While this path should come from the shell, there seems to be a
;; condition where I need to set this so that Emacs can pull our my
;; compiled files.

(add-to-list 'exec-path "/usr/local/bin")

(setenv "PATH" (concat "/usr/local/bin:" (getenv "PATH")))
(defvar hamacs-source-dir "$HAMACS_DIR" "Where we be.")

;; Let's rock:
(org-babel-load-file "$HAMACS_DIR/bootstrap.org")
