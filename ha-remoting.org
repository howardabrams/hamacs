* Remote Editing with Tramp
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][Tramp]] allows almost all Emacs features to execute on a remote system.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tramp
    :straight (:type built-in)

    :config
    ;; Use remote PATH on tramp (handy for eshell).
    (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path)

    ;; Make sure version control system doesn't slow tramp:
    (setq vc-ignore-dir-regexp
          (format "%s\\|%s" vc-ignore-dir-regexp tramp-file-name-regexp)))
#+end_src

Will Schenk has [[https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tramp_tricks/][a simple extension]] to allow editing of files /inside/ a Docker container:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tramp
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :config
    (push '("docker" . ((tramp-login-program "docker")
                        (tramp-login-args (("exec" "-it") ("%h") ("/bin/sh")))
                        (tramp-remote-shell "/bin/sh")
                        (tramp-remote-shell-args ("-i") ("-c"))))
          tramp-methods)

    (defun ha-tramp-completion-docker (orig-fun &rest args)
      "Advice for `tramp-completion-handle-file-name-all-completions`.
  Return active Docker container names when completing for `/docker:`."
      (if (equal (nth 1 args) "/docker:")
          (let* ((command "docker ps --format '{{.Names}}:'")
                 (dockernames-raw (shell-command-to-string command))
                 (dockernames (split-string dockernames-raw "\n" t)))
            dockernames)
        ;; Call the original function
        (apply orig-fun args)))

    (advice-add 'tramp-completion-handle-file-name-all-completions
                :around #'ha-tramp-completion-docker)
#+end_src

Keep in mind you need to /name/ your Docker session, with the =—name= option. I actually do more docker work on remote systems (as Docker seems to make my fans levitate my laptop over the desk). Granted, the =URL= is a bit lengthy, for instance:
#+begin_example
/ssh:kolla-compute1.cedev13.d501.eng.pdx.wd|sudo:kolla-compute1.cedev13.d501.eng.pdx.wd|docker:kolla_toolbox:/
#+end_example
Which means, I need to put it as a link in an org file.

*Note:* That we need to have Tramp SSH option comes from my personal [[file:~/.ssh/config][.ssh/config]] file instead of its internal cache:
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tramp-sh
    :after tramp
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :custom (tramp-use-ssh-controlmaster-options nil))
#+end_src
* Remote Terminals
Sure =iTerm= is nice for connecting and running commands on remote systems, however, it lacks a command line option that allows you to select and manipulate the displayed text without a mouse. This is where Emacs can shine.

Interactive Functions:

  - ha-shell :: create a local shell in default-directory. This is an abstraction mostly used for my demonstrations, otherwise, I can just call the =make-term= or =eat= directly.
  - ha-ssh :: create a shell on remote system

*Feature One:*

When calling the =ha-ssh= function, it opens a =vterm= window which, unlike other terminal emulators in Emacs, merges both Emacs and Terminal behaviors. Essentially, it just works. It =vterm= isn't installed, it falls back to either =eat= or good ol’ =term=.

Preload a list of favorite/special hostnames with multiple calls to:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (ha-ssh-add-favorite-host "Devbox 42" "10.0.1.42")
#+end_src

Then calling =ha-ssh= function, a list of hostnames is available to quickly jump on a system (with the possibility of fuzzy matching if you have Helm or Ivy installed).

This also has the ability to call OpenStack to gather the hostnames of dynamic systems (what I call "an Overcloud"), which is appended to the list of favorite hostnames. The call to OpenStack only needs to be called once, since the hosts are then cached, see =ha-ssh-overcloud-query-for-hosts=.

*Feature Two:*

Use the /favorite host/ list to quickly edit a file on a remote system using Tramp, by calling either =ha-ssh-find-file= and =ha-ssh-find-root=.

*Feature Three:*

Working with remote shell connections programmatically, for instance:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (let ((win-name "some-host"))
    (ha-ssh "some-host.in.some.place" win-name)
    (ha-ssh-send "source ~/.bash_profile" win-name)
    (ha-ssh-send "clear" win-name))
  ;; ...
  (ha-ssh-exit win-name)
#+end_src

Actually the =win-name= in this case is optional, as it will use a good default.

** VTerm
I'm not giving up on Eshell, but I am playing around with [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][vterm]], and it is pretty good, but I use it primarily as a more reliable approach for remote terminal sessions.

VTerm has an issue (at least for me) with ~M-Backspace~ not deleting the previous word, and yeah, I want to make sure that both keystrokes do the same thing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package vterm
    :config
    (setq vterm-shell "zsh"
          vterm-kill-buffer-on-exit t)

    (ha-leader
      "p t" '("terminal" . (lambda () (interactive) (ha-shell (project-root (project-current))))))

    (dolist (k '("<C-backspace>" "<M-backspace>"))
      (define-key vterm-mode-map (kbd k)
                  (lambda () (interactive) (vterm-send-key (kbd "C-w")))))

    ;; Enter copy mode? Go to Evil's normal state to move around:
    (when (fboundp 'evil-normal-state)
      (advice-add 'vterm-copy-mode :after 'evil-normal-state))

    :hook
    (vterm-mode . (lambda ()
                    (when (boundp 'evil-insert-state-cursor)
                      (setq-local evil-insert-state-cursor 'box))
                    (setq-local show-paren-mode nil)
                    (setf truncate-lines nil
                          vterm-use-vterm-prompt-detection-method nil
                          term-prompt-regexp "^.* $ ")
                    (flycheck-mode -1)
                    (yas-minor-mode -1) ;; This actually code be interesting, but...

                    (when (fboundp 'evil-insert-state)
                      (evil-insert-state)))))
#+end_src

The advantage of running terminals in Emacs is the ability to copy text without a mouse. For that, hit ~C-c C-t~ to enter a special copy-mode. If I go into this mode, I might as well also go into normal mode to move the cursor. To exit the copy-mode (and copy the selected text to the clipboard), hit ~Return~.
** Eat
While not as fast as [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][vterm]], the [[https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-eat][Emulate a Terminal]] project (eat) is fast enough, and doesn’t require a dedicate library that requires re-compilation. While offering [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu-devel/doc/eat.html][online documentation]], I’m glad for an [[info:eat#Top][Info version]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (use-package eat
    :straight (:host codeberg :repo "akib/emacs-eat"
                     :files ("*.el" ("term" "term/*.el") "*.texi"
                             "*.ti" ("terminfo/e" "terminfo/efo/e/*")
                             ("terminfo/65" "terminfo/65/*")
                             ("integration" "integration/*")
                             (:exclude ".dir-locals.el" "*-tests.el")))
    :commands (eat eat-make eat-project)
    :bind (:map eat-semi-char-mode-map
                ("C-c C-t" . ha-eat-narrow-to-shell-prompt-dwim))
    :config
    (defun ha-eat-narrow-to-shell-prompt-dwim ()
       (interactive)
       (if (buffer-narrowed-p) (widen) (eat-narrow-to-shell-prompt)))
    (ha-leader
      "p t" '("terminal" . eat-project)))
#+END_SRC

The largest change, is like the venerable [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Term-Mode.html][term mode]], we have different modes:

  - =semi-char= :: This DWIM mode works halfway between an Emacs buffer and a terminal. Use ~C-c C-e~ to go to =emacs= mode.
  - =emacs= :: Good ol’ Emacs buffer, use ~C-c C-j~ to go back to =semi-char= mode.
  - =char= :: Full terminal mode, use ~M-RET~ to pop back to =semi-char= mode.
  - =line= :: Line-oriented mode, not sure why I’d use it.

Cool stuff:
  - ~C-n~ / ~C-p~ :: scrolls the command history
  - ~C-c C-n~ / ~C-c C-p~ :: jumps to the various prompts

What about Evil mode?

TODO: Like =eshell=, the Bash in an EAT terminal has a command =_eat_msg= that takes a handler, and a /message/. Then set up an alist of =eat-message-handler-alist= to decide what to do with it.

TODO: Need to /subtlize/ the =eat-term-color-bright-green= and other settings as it is way too garish.

Make sure you add the following for Bash:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
  [ -n "$EAT_SHELL_INTEGRATION_DIR" ] && \
    source "$EAT_SHELL_INTEGRATION_DIR/bash"
#+END_SRC

** Variables
Let's begin by defining some variables used for communication between the functions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar ha-latest-ssh-window-name nil
    "The window-name of the latest ssh session. Most commands default to the last session.")

  (defvar ha-ssh-host-history '() "List of hostnames we've previously connected.")

  (defvar ha-ssh-favorite-hostnames '()
    "A list of tuples (associate list) containing a hostname and its IP address.
  See =ha-ssh-add-favorite-host= for easily adding to this list.")
#+end_src

** Terminal Abstractions
Could I abstract the different ways I start terminals in Emacs? The =ha-ssh-term= starts either a [[VTerm]]
or [[Eat]] terminals, depending on what is available. This replaces (wraps) the default [[help:make-term][make-term]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-make-term (name &optional program startfile &rest switches)
    "Create a terminal buffer NAME based on available emulation.
  The PROGRAM, if non-nil, is executed, otherwise, this is `ha-shell'.
  STARTFILE is the initial text given to the PROGRAM, and the
  SWITCHES are the command line options."
    (cond
     ((fboundp 'vterm) (progn (vterm name)
                              (when program
                                (vterm-send-string (append program switches))
                                (vterm-send-return))))
     ((fboundp 'eat)   (progn (switch-to-buffer
                               (apply 'eat-make (append (list name program startfile)
                                                        switches)))
                              (setq-local ha-eat-terminal eat-terminal)))
     (t                (switch-to-buffer
                        (apply 'make-term (append (list name program startfile)
                                                  switches))))))
#+END_SRC

** Interactive Interface to Remote Systems

The function, =ha-ssh= pops up a list of /favorite hosts/ and then uses the =vterm= functions to automatically SSH into the chosen host:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh (hostname &optional window-name)
    "Start a SSH session to a given HOSTNAME (with an optionally specified WINDOW-NAME).
  If called interactively, it presents the user with a list
  returned by =ha-ssh-choose-host=."
    (interactive (list (ha-ssh-choose-host)))
    (unless window-name
      (setq window-name (format "ssh: %s" hostname)))
    (setq ha-latest-ssh-window-name (format "*%s*" window-name))
    (ha-make-term window-name "ssh" nil hostname)
    (pop-to-buffer ha-latest-ssh-window-name))
#+end_src

Of course, we need a function that =interactive= can call to get that list, and my thought is to call =helm= if it is available, otherwise, assume that ido/ivy will take over the =completing-read= function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh-choose-host ()
    "Prompts the user for a host, and if it is in the cache, return
  its IP address, otherwise, return the input given.
  This is used in calls to =interactive= to select a host."
    (completing-read-alist "Hostname: " ha-ssh-favorite-hostnames nil 'confirm
                           nil 'ha-ssh-host-history))
#+end_src

Before we leave this section, I realize that I would like a way to /add/ to my list of hosts:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh-add-favorite-host (hostname ip-address)
    "Add a favorite host to your list for easy pickin's."
    (interactive "sHostname: \nsIP Address: ")
    (add-to-list 'ha-ssh-favorite-hostnames (cons hostname ip-address)))
#+end_src

** Programmatic Interface
For the sake of my demonstrations, I use =ha-shell= to start a terminal with a particular =name=. Then, I can send commands into it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-shell (&optional directory name)
    "Creates a terminal window using `ha-make-term'.
  Stores the name, for further calls to `ha-shell-send', and
  `ha-shell-send-lines'."
    (interactive (list (read-directory-name "Starting Directory: " (project-root (project-current)))))
    (let* ((default-directory (or directory default-directory))
           (win-name (or name (replace-regexp-in-string (rx (+? any)
                                                            (group (1+ (not "/")))
                                                            (optional "/") eol)
                                                        "\\1"
                                                        default-directory)))
           (buf-name (format "*%s*" win-name)))
      (setq ha-latest-ssh-window-name buf-name)
      (ha-make-term win-name)))  ; Lisp-2 FTW!?
#+end_src

Now that Emacs can /host/ a Terminal shell, I would like to /programmatically/ send commands to the running terminal, e.g. =(ha-shell-send "ls *.py")= I would really like to be able to send and execute a command in a terminal from a script.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-shell-send (command &optional name)
    "Send COMMAND to existing shell terminal based on DIRECTORY.
    If you want to refer to another session, specify the correct NAME.
    This is really useful for scripts and demonstrations."
    (unless name
      (setq name ha-latest-ssh-window-name))

    (save-window-excursion
      (pop-to-buffer name)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (cond
       ((eq major-mode 'vterm-mode) (progn
                                      (vterm-send-string command)
                                      (vterm-send-return)))
       ((eq major-mode 'eat-mode) (eat-term-send-string
                                   ha-eat-terminal (concat command "\n")))
       (t (progn
            (insert command)
            (term-send-input))))))
#+end_src

Let's have a quick way to bugger out of the terminal:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-shell-exit (&optional name)
    "End the SSH session specified by NAME (or if not, the latest session)."
    (interactive)
    (unless (or (eq major-mode 'vterm-mode)   ; Already in a term?
                (eq major-mode 'eat-mode)     ; Just close this.
                (eq major-mode 'term-mode))
      (unless name
        (setq name ha-latest-ssh-window-name))
      (pop-to-buffer name))

    (ignore-errors
      (term-send-eof))
    (kill-buffer name)
    (delete-window))
#+end_src

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (ha-shell)
  (ha-shell-send "date")
  (ha-shell-exit)
#+END_SRC

As you may know, I’m big into /literate devops/ where I put my shell commands in org files. However, I also work as part of a team that for some reason, doesn’t accept Emacs as their One True Editor. At least, I am able to talk them into describing commands in Markdown files, e.g. =README.md=. Instead of /copying-pasting/ into the shell, could I /send/ the /current command/ to that shell?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-shell-send-line (prefix &optional name)
    "Copy the contents of the current line in the current buffer,
  and call `ha-sshell-send' with it. After sending the contents, it
  returns to the current location. PREFIX is the number of lines."
    (interactive "P")
    (dolist (line (ha-ssh--line-or-block prefix))
      ;; (sit-for 0.25)
      (ha-shell-send line)))
#+end_src

What does /current command/ mean? The current line? A good fall back. Selected region? Sure, if active, but that seems like more work. In a Markdown file, I can gather the entire source code block, just like in an Org file.
So the following function may be a bit complicated in determining what is this /current code/:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh--line-or-block (num-lines)
    "Return a list of the NUM-LINES from current buffer.
  If NUM-LINES is nil, then follow these rules:
  If the region is active, return the lines from that.
  If in an org-mode block, return that block.
  If in a Markdown file, return the triple-back-tick code,
  or the indented code, or the inline code between single ticks.
  Otherwise, just return the current line."
    (ha-ssh--line-cleanup
     (cond
      ((and num-lines (numberp num-lines))
       (buffer-substring-no-properties
        (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position num-lines)))

      ;; Region active?
      ((region-active-p)
       (buffer-substring-no-properties
        (region-beginning) (region-end)))

      ;; In org? Use the block
      ((and (eq major-mode 'org-mode) (org-in-src-block-p))
       (org-element-property :value (org-element-at-point)))

      ;; In Markdown block?
      ((and (eq major-mode 'markdown-mode) (markdown-code-block-at-point-p))
       (buffer-substring-no-properties
        (car (markdown-code-block-at-point-p))
        (cadr (markdown-code-block-at-point-p))))

      ;; In Markdown code that is just on part of the line?
      ((and (eq major-mode 'markdown-mode) (markdown-inline-code-at-point-p))
       (buffer-substring-no-properties
        (car (markdown-inline-code-at-point-p))
        (cadr (markdown-inline-code-at-point-p))))

      (t      ; Otherwise, just grab the current line:
       (buffer-substring-no-properties
        (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))))))
#+end_src

In Markdown (and org), I might have initial spaces that should be removed (but not all initial spaces):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh--line-cleanup (str)
    "Return STR as a list of strings."
    (let* ((lst-contents (thread-last str
                                      (s-split "\n")
                                      (-remove 's-blank-str-p)))
           (first-line   (car lst-contents))
           (trim-amount  (when (string-match (rx bol (group (* space))) first-line)
                           (length (match-string 1 first-line)))))
      (mapcar (lambda (line) (substring line trim-amount)) lst-contents)))
#+end_src

And some tests to validate:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (ert-deftest ha-ssh--line-cleanup-test ()
    (should (equal (ha-ssh--line-cleanup "bob") '("bob")))
    (should (equal (ha-ssh--line-cleanup "  bob") '("bob")))
    (should (equal (ha-ssh--line-cleanup "bob\nfoo") '("bob" "foo")))
    (should (equal (ha-ssh--line-cleanup "  bob\n  foo") '("bob" "foo")))
    (should (equal (ha-ssh--line-cleanup "  bob\n    foo") '("bob" "  foo"))))
#+END_SRC

** Editing Remote Files
TRAMP, when it works, is amazing that we can give it a reference to a remote directory, and have =find-file= magically autocomplete.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh-find-file (hostname)
    "Constructs a ssh-based, tramp-focus, file reference, and then calls =find-file=."
    (interactive (list (ha-ssh-choose-host)))
    (let ((tramp-ssh-ref (format "/ssh:%s:" hostname))
          (other-window (when (equal current-prefix-arg '(4)) t)))
      (ha-ssh--find-file tramp-ssh-ref other-window)))

  (defun ha-ssh--find-file (tramp-ssh-ref &optional other-window)
    "Calls =find-file= after internally completing a file reference based on TRAMP-SSH-REF."
    (let ((tramp-file (read-file-name "Find file: " tramp-ssh-ref)))
      (if other-window
          (find-file-other-window tramp-file)
        (find-file tramp-file))))
#+end_src

We can even edit it as root:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh-find-file-root (hostname)
    "Constructs a ssh-based, tramp-focus, file reference, and then calls =find-file=."
    (interactive (list (ha-ssh-choose-host)))
    (let ((tramp-ssh-ref (format "/ssh:%s|sudo:%s:" hostname hostname))
          (other-window (when (equal current-prefix-arg '(4)) t)))
      (ha-ssh--find-file tramp-ssh-ref other-window)))
#+end_src

** OpenStack Interface

Instead of making sure I have a list of remote systems already in the favorite hosts cache, I can pre-populate it with a call to OpenStack (my current VM system I'm using). These calls to the =openstack= CLI assume that the environment is already filled with the credentials. Hey, it is my local laptop ...

We'll give =openstack= CLI a =--format json= option to make it easier for parsing:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package json)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh-overcloud-query-for-hosts ()
    "If the overcloud cache hasn't be populated, ask the user if we want to run the command."
    (unless ha-ssh-favorite-hostnames
      (when (y-or-n-p "Cache of Overcloud hosts aren't populated. Retrieve hosts?")
        (call-interactively 'ha-ssh-overcloud-cache-populate))))

  (advice-add 'ha-ssh-choose-host :before 'ha-ssh-overcloud-query-for-hosts)
#+end_src

We'll do the work of getting the /server list/ with this function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh-overcloud-cache-populate (cluster)
    "Given an `os-cloud' entry, stores all available hostnames.
  Calls `ha-ssh-add-favorite-host' for each host found."
    (interactive (list (completing-read "Cluster: " '(devprod501 devprod502 devprod502-yawxway))))
    (message "Calling the `openstack' command...this will take a while. Grab a coffee, eh?")
    (let* ((command (format "openstack --os-cloud %s server list --no-name-lookup -f json" cluster))
           (json-data (thread-last command
                                   (shell-command-to-string)
                                   (json-read-from-string))))
      (dolist (entry (seq--into-list json-data))
        (ha-ssh-add-favorite-host (alist-get 'Name entry)
                                  (or
                                   (thread-last entry
                                                (alist-get 'Networks)
                                                (alist-get 'cedev13)
                                                (seq-first))
                                   (alist-get 'Name entry))))
      (message "Call to `openstack' complete. Found %d hosts." (length json-data))))
#+end_src

The primary interface:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-ssh-overcloud (hostname)
    "Log into an overcloud host given by HOSTNAME. Works better if
  you have previously run =ssh-copy-id= on the host. Remember, to
  make it behave like a real terminal (instead of a window in
  Emacs), hit =C-c C-k=."
    (interactive (list (ha-ssh-choose-host)))
    (when (not (string-match-p "\." hostname))
      (setq hostname (format "%s.%s" hostname (getenv "OS_PROJECT_NAME"))))

    (let ((window-label (or (thread-last ha-ssh-favorite-hostnames
                                         (rassoc hostname)
                                         (car))
                            hostname)))
      (ha-ssh hostname window-label)))
#+end_src
* Keybindings
This file, so far, as been good-enough for a Vanilla Emacs installation, but to hook into Doom's leader for some sequence binding, this code isn't:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ha-leader
    "a s"  '(:ignore t :which-key "ssh")
    "a s o" '("overcloud"     . ha-ssh-overcloud)
    "a s l" '("local shell"   . ha-shell)
    "a s s" '("remote shell"  . ha-ssh)
    "a s p" '("project shell" . eat-project)
    "a s q" '("quit shell"    . ha-ssh-exit)
    "a s f" '("find-file"     . ha-ssh-find-file)
    "a s r" '("find-root"     . ha-ssh-find-root)
    "a s b" '("send line"     . ha-ssh-send-line))
#+end_src
* Technical Artifacts                                :noexport:
Provide a name so we can =require= the file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports none
  (provide 'ha-remoting)
  ;;; ha-remoting.el ends here
#+end_src

Before you can build this on a new system, make sure that you put the cursor over any of these properties, and hit: ~C-c C-c~
