#+end_src
* Introduction
Seems that all programming interfaces and workflows behave similarly. One other helper routine is a =general= macro for org-mode files:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (general-create-definer ha-prog-leader
      :states '(normal visual motion)
      :keymaps 'prog-mode-map
      :prefix "SPC m"
      :global-prefix "<f17>"
      :non-normal-prefix "S-SPC")
#+end_src
* General
The following work for all programming languages.
** direnv
Farm off commands into /virtual environments/:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package direnv
    :init
    (setq direnv--executable "/usr/local/bin/direnv"
          direnv-always-show-summary t
          direnv-show-paths-in-summary t)
    :config
    (direnv-mode))
#+end_src
** Spell Checking Comments
The [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell#h5o-2][flyspell-prog-mode]] checks for misspellings in comments.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flyspell
  :hook (prog-mode . flyspell-prog-mode))
#+end_src
** Flycheck
Why use [[https://www.flycheck.org/][flycheck]] over the built-in =flymake=? Speed used to be the advantage, but I’m now pushing much of this to LSP, so speed is less of an issue.  What about when I am not using LSP? Also, since I’ve hooked grammar checkers, I need this with global keybindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck
    :init
    (setq next-error-message-highlight t)
    :bind (:map flycheck-error-list-mode-map
                ("C-n" . 'flycheck-error-list-next-error)
                ("C-p" . 'flycheck-error-list-previous-error)
                ("j"   . 'flycheck-error-list-next-error)
                ("k"   . 'flycheck-error-list-previous-error))
    :config
    (flymake-mode -1)
    (global-flycheck-mode)
    (ha-leader "t c" 'flycheck-mode)

    (ha-leader
      ">" '("next problem" . flycheck-next-error)
      "<" '("previous problem" . flycheck-previous-error)

      "P" '(:ignore t :which-key "problems")
      "P b" '("error buffer" . flycheck-buffer)
      "P c" '("clear" . flycheck-clear)
      "P n" '("next" . flycheck-next-error)
      "P N" '("next" . flycheck-next-error)
      "P p" '("previous" . flycheck-previous-error)
      "P P" '("previous" . flycheck-previous-error)
      "P l" '("list all" . flycheck-list-errors)
      "P y" '("copy errors" . flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill)
      "P s" '("select checker" . flycheck-select-checker)
      "P ?" '("describe checker" . flycheck-describe-checker)
      "P h" '("display error" . flycheck-display-error-at-point)
      "P e" '("explain error" . flycheck-explain-error-at-point)
      "P H" '("help" . display-local-help)
      "P i" '("manual" . flycheck-manual)
      "P V" '("version" . flycheck-version)
      "P v" '("verify-setup" . flycheck-verify-setup)
      "P x" '("disable-checker" . flycheck-disable-checker)
      "P t" '("toggle flycheck" . flycheck-mode)))
#+end_src
** Documentation
I’m interested in using [[https://devdocs.io/][devdocs]] instead, which is similar, but keeps it all /inside/ Emacs (and works on my Linux system). Two Emacs projects compete for this position. The Emacs [[https://github.com/astoff/devdocs.el][devdocs]] project is active, and seems to work well. Its advantage is a special mode for moving around the documentation.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package devdocs
    :general (:states 'normal "gD" 'devdocs-lookup)

    :config
    (ha-prog-leader
      "d"  '(:ignore t :which-key "docs")
      "d e" '("eldoc" . eldoc)
      "d d" '("open" . devdocs-lookup)
      "d p" '("peruse" . devdocs-peruse)
      "d i" '("install" . devdocs-install)
      "d u" '("update" . devdocs-update-all)
      "d x" '("uninstall" . devdocs-delete)
      "d s" '("search" . devdocs-search)))
#+end_src

The [[https://github.com/blahgeek/emacs-devdocs-browser][devdocs-browser]] project acts similar, but with slightly different command names. Its advantage is that it allows for downloading docs and having it available offline, in fact, you can’t search for a function, until you download its pack. This is slightly faster because of this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (use-package devdocs-browser
    :general (:states 'normal "gD" 'devdocs-browser-open)

    :config
    (ha-prog-leader
      "d"  '(:ignore t :which-key "docs")
      "d d" '("open" . devdocs-browser-open)
      "d D" '("open in" . devdocs-browser-open-in)
      "d l" '("list" . devdocs-browser-list-docs)
      "d u" '("update" . devdocs-browser-update-docs)
      "d i" '("install" . devdocs-browser-install-doc)
      "d x" '("uninstall" . devdocs-browser-uninstall-doc)
      "d U" '("upgrade" . devdocs-browser-upgrade-doc)
      "d o" '("download" . devdocs-browser-download-offline-data)
      "d O" '("remove download" . devdocs-browser-remove-offline-data)))
#+end_src
** Code Folding
While Emacs has options for viewing and moving around code, sometimes, we could /collapse/ all functions, and then start to expand them one at a time. For this, we could enable the built-in [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HideShow][hide-show feature]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (use-package hide-show
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :init
    (setq hs-hide-comments t
          hs-hide-initial-comment-block t
          hs-isearch-open t)
    :hook (prog-mode . hs-minor-mode))
#+end_src
Note that =hide-show= doesn’t work with complex YAML files. The [[https://github.com/gregsexton/origami.el][origami]] mode works better /out-of-the-box/, as it works with Python and Lisp, but falls back to indents as the format, which works well.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package origami
    :init
    (setq origami-fold-replacement "⤵")
    :hook (prog-mode . origami-mode))
#+end_src
To take advantage of this, type:
  - ~z m~ :: To collapse everything
  - ~z r~ :: To open everything
  - ~z o~ :: To open a particular section
  - ~z c~ :: To collapse a /section/ (like a function)
  - ~z a~ :: Toggles open to close

Note: Yes, we could use [[https://github.com/mrkkrp/vimish-fold][vimish-fold]] (and its cousin, [[https://github.com/alexmurray/evil-vimish-fold][evil-vimish-fold]]) and we’ll see if I need those.
** Navigation with dumb-jump
Once upon a time, we use to create a =TAGS= file that contained the database for navigating code bases, but with new faster versions of grep, e.g.  [[https://beyondgrep.com][ack]], [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][ag]] (aka, the Silver Searcher),  [[https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep][ugrep]] and [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]], we should just be able to use them.  but I want to:
  - Be in a function, and see its callers. For this, the [[help:rg-dwim][rg-dwim]] function is my bread-and-butter.
  - Be on a function, and jump to the definition. For this, I use [[https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump][dumb-jump]], which uses the above utilities.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dumb-jump
    :init
    (setq dumb-jump-prefer-searcher 'rg)

    :config
    (setq xref-show-definitions-function #'xref-show-definitions-completing-read)
    (add-hook 'xref-backend-functions #'dumb-jump-xref-activate)

    (ha-prog-leader
      "s"  '(:ignore t :which-key "search")
      "s s" '("search" . xref-find-apropos)
      "s d" '("definitions" . xref-find-definitions)
      "s o" '("other window" . xref-find-definitions-other-window)
      "s r" '("references" . xref-find-references)
      "s b" '("back" . xref-pop-marker-stack))

    :general (:states 'normal
                      "gh" 'xref-find-apropos
                      "gb" 'xref-pop-marker-stack))
#+end_src
** Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration
The [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][LSP]] is a way to connect /editors/ (like Emacs) to /languages/ (like Lisp)… wait, no, it was originally designed for VS Code and probably Python, but we now abstract away [[https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi][Jedi]] and the [[http://tkf.github.io/emacs-jedi/latest/][Emacs integration to Jedi]] (and duplicate everything for Ruby, and Clojure, and…).

Emacs has two LSP projects, and while I have used [[LSP Mode]], but since I don’t have heavy IDE requirements, I am finding that [[eglot]] to be simpler.
*** eglot
The [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]] package usually connects to Emacs’ standard command interface, so the eglot-specific code is mostly in controlling the backend servers. That said, it has a couple of =eglot-= commands that I want easy access to:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package eglot
    :config
    (ha-prog-leader
      "w"  '(:ignore t :which-key "eglot")
      "ws" '("start" . eglot)
      "wr" '("restart" . eglot-reconnect)
      "wb" '("events" . eglot-events-buffer)
      "we" '("errors" . eglot-stderr-buffer)
      "wq" '("quit" . eglot-shutdown)
      "wQ" '("quit all" . eglot-shutdown-all)

      "r" '("rename" . eglot-rename)
      "=" '("format" . eglot-format)
      "a" '("code actions" . eglot-code-actions)
      "i" '("imports" . eglot-code-action-organize-imports)))
#+end_src
*** Display Configuration
Using the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][Doom Modeline]] to add notifications:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-modeline
    :config
    (setq doom-modeline-lsp t
          doom-modeline-env-version t))
#+end_src
** Function Call Notifications
As I've mentioned [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/beep-for-emacs.html][on my website]], I've created a [[file:~/website/Technical/Emacs/beep-for-emacs.org][beep function]] that notifies when long running processes complete.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package alert
    :init
    (setq alert-default-style
          (if (ha-running-on-macos?)
              'osx-notifier
            'libnotify)))

  (use-package beep
    :straight nil   ; Already in the load-path
    :hook (after-init . (lambda () (beep--when-finished "Emacs has started")))
    :config
    (dolist (func '(org-publish
                    org-publish-all
                    org-publish-project
                    compile
                    shell-command))
      (advice-add func :around #'beep-when-runs-too-long)))
#+end_src
While that code /advices/ the publishing and compile commands, I may want to add more.
** iEdit
While there are language-specific ways to rename variables and functions, [[https://github.com/victorhge/iedit][iedit]] is often sufficient.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package iedit
    :config
    (ha-leader "s e" '("iedit" . iedit-mode)))
#+end_src
** Commenting
I like =comment-dwim= (~M-;~), and I like =comment-box=, but I have an odd personal style that I like to codify:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun ha-comment-line (&optional start end)
  (interactive "r")
  (when (or (null start) (not (region-active-p)))
    (setq start (line-beginning-position))
    (setq end   (line-end-position)))
  (save-excursion
    (narrow-to-region start end)
    (upcase-region start end)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (insert "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
    (goto-char (point-max))
    (insert "\n------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    (comment-region (point-min) (point-max))
    (widen)))
#+end_src
And a keybinding:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ha-prog-leader "c" '("comment line" . ha-comment-line))
#+end_src
** Evaluation
While I like [[help:eval-print-last-sexp][eval-print-last-sexp]], I would like a bit of formatting in order to /keep the results/ in the file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-eval-print-last-sexp (&optional internal-arg)
    "Evaluate the expression located before the point.
  The results are inserted back into the buffer at the end
  of the line after a comment."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (eval-print-last-sexp internal-arg))
    (end-of-line)
    (insert "  ")
    (insert comment-start)
    (insert "⟹ ")
    (dotimes (i 2)
      (next-line)
      (join-line)))
#+end_src

Typical keybindings for all programming modes:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ha-prog-leader
     "e"  '(:ignore t :which-key "eval")
     "e ;" '("expression" . eval-expression)
     "e b" '("buffer" . eval-buffer)
     "e f" '("function" . eval-defun)
     "e r" '("region" . eval-region)
     "e e" '("last s-exp" . eval-last-sexp)
     "e p" '("print s-exp" . ha-eval-print-last-sexp))
#+end_src
** Ligatures
The idea of using math symbols for a programming languages keywords is /cute/, but can be confusing, so I use it sparingly:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ha-prettify-prog ()
    "Extends the `prettify-symbols-alist' for programming."
    (mapc (lambda (pair) (push pair prettify-symbols-alist))
          '(("lambda" . "𝝀")
            (">=" . "≥")
            ("<=" . "≤")
            ("!=" . "≠")))
    (prettify-symbols-mode))

  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'ha-prettify-prog)
#+end_src
Eventually, I want to follow [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/unicode-ligatures-color-emoji][Mickey Petersen's essay]] on getting full ligatures working, but right now, they don’t work on the Mac, and that is my current workhorse.
** Task Runner
I've replaced my home-grown compilation list code with a more versatile [[https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/emacs-taskrunner][Taskrunner project]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq ivy-taskrunner-notifications-on t
      ivy-taskrunner-doit-bin-path "/usr/local/bin/doit")
#+end_src

Doom provides basic support, but we need more keybindings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(map! :leader :prefix "p"
      :desc "Project tasks" "Z" 'ivy-taskrunner
      :desc "Reun last task" "z" 'ivy-taskrunner-rerun-last-command)
#+end_src

While my company is typically using =Rakefile= and =Makefile= in the top-level project, I want to have my personal tasks set per-project as well. For that, I thought about using [[https://pydoit.org/][doit]], where I would just create a =dodo.py= file that contains:

#+begin_src python :tangle no
 def hello():
     """This command greets you."""
     return {
         'actions': [ 'echo hello' ],
     }
#+end_src

* Languages
Simple to configure languages go here. More advanced stuff will go in their own files… eventually.
** Markdown
All the READMEs and other documentation use [[https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/][markdown-mode]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode
    :mode ("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode)
    :init (setq markdown-command "multimarkdown")
    :general
    (:states 'normal :no-autoload t :keymaps 'markdown-mode-map
             "SPC m l" '("insert link" . markdown-insert-link)
             ;; SPC u 3 SPC m h for a third-level header:
             "SPC m h" '("insert header" . markdown-insert-header-dwim)
             "SPC m e" '("export" . markdown-export)
             "SPC m p" '("preview" . markdown-export-and-preview)))
#+end_src
Note that the markdown-specific commands use the ~C-c C-c~ and  ~C-c C-s~ prefixes.
** Ansible
Doing a lot of [[https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode][YAML work]], but this project needs a new maintainer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package yaml-mode
  :mode (rx ".y" (optional "a") "ml" string-end))
#+end_src

Ansible uses Jinja, so we install the [[https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/jinja2-mode][jinja2-mode]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package jinja2-mode
  :mode (rx ".j2" string-end))
#+end_src

Do I consider all YAML files an Ansible file needing [[https://github.com/k1LoW/emacs-ansible][ansible-mode]]?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ansible
    :init
    (setq ansible-vault-password-file "~/.ansible-vault-passfile")
    ;; :hook (yaml-mode . ansible-mode)
    :config
    (ha-leader "t y" 'ansible))
#+end_src
The [[help:ansible-vault-password-file][ansible-vault-password-file]] variable needs to change /per project/, so let’s use the =.dir-locals.el= file, for instance:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ((nil . ((ansible-vault-password-file . "playbooks/.vault-password"))))

#+end_src

However, let’s have all YAML files able to access Ansible’s documentation using the [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/ansible-doc][ansible-doc]] project:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ansible-doc
    :hook (yaml-mode . ansible-doc-mode)
    :config
    (ha-local-leader :keymaps 'yaml-mode-map
      "d"  '(:ignore t :which-key "docs")
      "d d" 'ansible-doc))
#+end_src

The [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/poly-ansible][poly-ansible]] project uses [[https://polymode.github.io/][polymode]], gluing [[https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/jinja2-mode][jinja2-mode]] into [[https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode][yaml-mode]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package polymode)

  (use-package poly-ansible
    :after polymode
    :straight (:host github :repo "emacsmirror/poly-ansible")
    :hook ((yaml-mode . poly-ansible-mode)
           (poly-ansible-mode . font-lock-update)))
#+end_src

** Shell Scripts
While I don't like writing them, I can't get away from them. Check out the goodies in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTC6SP7R1hA&t=5s][this video]].

While filename extensions work fine most of the time, I don't like to pre-pend =.sh= to the shell scripts I write, and instead, would like to associate =shell-mode= with all files in a =bin= directory:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sh-mode
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :mode (rx (or (seq ".sh" eol)
                  "/bin/"))
    :init
    (setq sh-basic-offset 2
          sh-indentation 2)
    :config
    (ha-auto-insert-file (rx (or (seq ".sh" eol)
                                 "/bin/"))
                         "sh-mode.sh")
    :hook
    (after-save . executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p))
#+end_src
*Note:* we make the script /executable/ by default. See [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2021/09/29/make-script-files-executable-automatically/][this essay]] for details, but it turns on the executable bit if the script has a shebang at the top of the file.

The [[https://www.shellcheck.net/][shellcheck]] project integrates with [[Flycheck]]. First, install the executable into the system, for instance, on a Mac:
#+begin_src sh
  brew install shellcheck
#+end_src
And we can enable it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (flycheck-may-enable-checker 'sh-shellcheck)
#+end_src
Place the following /on a line/ before a shell script warning to ignore it:
#+begin_src sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2116,SC2086
#+end_src
See [[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Ignore][this page]] for details.

Integration with the [[https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server][Bash LSP implementation]]. First, install that too:
#+begin_src sh
  brew install bash-language-server
#+end_src
** Fish Shell
I think the [[https://fishshell.com/][fish shell]] is an interesting experiment (and I appreciate the basics that come with [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/fish-mode][fish-mode]]).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package fish-mode
    :mode (rx ".fish" eol)
    :config
    (ha-auto-insert-file (rx ".fish") "fish-mode.sh")
    :hook
    (fish-mode . (lambda () (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'fish_indent-before-save))))
#+end_src
* Technical Artifacts                                :noexport:
Provide a name to =require= this code.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports none
  (provide 'ha-programming)
  ;;; ha-programming.el ends here
#+end_src

Before you can build this on a new system, make sure that you put the cursor over any of these properties, and hit: ~C-c C-c~
