* Configuring Elfeed
Let's get our feeds from a collection of org mode files. By default, Doom configures =rmh-elfeed-org-files= to [[file:~/Dropbox/org/elfeed.org][elfeed.org]] in =org-directory=, so that will be fine.

By setting this variable, we configure elfeed to use elfeed:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq rmh-elfeed-org-files (list (f-join hamacs-source-dir "ha-feed-reader.org")))
#+END_SRC

While I would like to share the /status/ of my reads, so ...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package elfeed
    :config
    (setq elfeed-db-directory "~/dropbox/.elfeed/")
    (evil-define-key 'normal elfeed-show-mode-map (kbd "q") 'delete-window)
    (evil-define-key 'normal elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "r") 'ha-elfeed-tag-unread)
    (evil-define-key 'normal elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "R") 'elfeed-search-update--force)

    ;; And let's make the Space pull of my general leader:
    (general-unbind elfeed-show-mode-map "SPC")
    (general-unbind elfeed-search-mode-map "SPC")

    (use-package elfeed-org
      :config
      (elfeed-org)))

  (defun ha-elfeed-tag-unread ()
    (interactive)
    (elfeed-search-untag-all 'unread)
    (elfeed-search-update))
#+END_SRC

According to Ben Maughan and [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/to-eww-or-not-to-eww/][this Pragmatic Emacs essay]], we could easily browse an article in the GUI browser instead of EWW with capital B:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun elfeed-show-visit-gui ()
  "Wrapper for elfeed-show-visit to use gui browser instead of eww"
  (interactive)
  (let ((browse-url-generic-program "/usr/bin/open"))
    (elfeed-show-visit t)))

(define-key elfeed-show-mode-map (kbd "B") 'elfeed-show-visit-gui)
#+END_SRC
Finally, we can add it to the =apps= menu:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ha-leader "a e" 'elfeed)
#+END_SRC
