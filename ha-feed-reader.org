* Configuring Elfeed
Let's get our feeds from a collection of org mode files. By default, Doom configures =rmh-elfeed-org-files= to [[file:~/Dropbox/org/elfeed.org][elfeed.org]] in =org-directory=, so that will be fine.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package elfeed
    :config
    ;; While I would like to share the /status/ of my reads, so ...
    (setq elfeed-db-directory "~/dropbox/.elfeed/")

    ;; Let's limit what is initially displayed, and then expand it:
    (setq elfeed-search-filter "@6-months-ago +unread -science -funny")

    ;; While not an elfeed-specific variable, this make reading articles
    ;; with images easier:
    (setq pixel-scroll-precision-mode t)

    (defvar ha-elfeeds--title (font-icons 'faicon "rss" :title "Feed Reader"))

    (major-mode-hydra-define elfeed-search-mode
      (:title ha-elfeeds--title)
      ("Feeds"
       (("U" (elfeed-search-fetch 4) "Refresh Feeds")
        ("u" elfeed-update "Update Screen")
        ("f" elfeed-search-live-filter "Filter")
        ("F" elfeed-search-clear-filter "Clear Filter")
        ("X" elfeed-unjam "Unjam"))
       "Entry"
       (("r" elfeed-search-untag-all-unread "Mark read" :color pink)
        ("R" ha-elfeed-tag-unread "Mark read/refresh")
        ("y" elfeed-search-yank "Copy URL"))))

    (major-mode-hydra-define elfeed-show-mode
      (:title ha-elfeeds-title)
      ("Entry"
       (("n" elfeed-show-next "Next Entry" :color pink)
        ("p" elfeed-show-prev "Previous Entry" :color pink))
       "Read"
       (("b" elfeed-show-visit "Show in EWW")
        ("B" elfeed-show-visit-gui "Show in Browser")
        ("y" elfeed-show-yank "Copy URL"))
       "Navigation"
       (("o" link-hint-open-link "Open Link")
        ("q" bury-buffer "Close")
        ("Q" delete-window "Close Window")))))

  (defun ha-elfeed-tag-unread ()
    (interactive)
    (elfeed-search-untag-all 'unread)
    (elfeed-search-update))
#+end_src

According to Ben Maughan and [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/to-eww-or-not-to-eww/][this Pragmatic Emacs essay]], we could easily browse an article in the GUI browser instead of EWW with capital B:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun elfeed-show-visit-gui ()
    "Wrapper for elfeed-show-visit to use gui browser instead of eww"
    (interactive)
    (let ((browse-url-generic-program "/usr/bin/open"))
      (elfeed-show-visit t)))
#+end_src

And some global keys to display them in the =apps= menu:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ha-leader "a f" `("feed reader" . ,(ha-app-perspective "elfeed" #'elfeed)))
#+end_src
* The Feeds :elfeed:
The [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]] project configures =elfeed= to read the RSS feeds from an Org file … like this one!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package elfeed-org
    :after elfeed
    :config
    (setq rmh-elfeed-org-files (list (f-join hamacs-source-dir "ha-feed-reader.org")))
    (elfeed-org))
#+end_src

The feeds that I would to read on Emacs involves longer essays, so I’m decided to trim the list down to avoid duplications with the RSS reader on my phone.
