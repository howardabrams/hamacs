Contributing
============

While this project constitutes my personal configuration for Emacs, I realize that every thing we do adds to the community, so I will state that your contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. That said, I am keeping this project open and inclusive, so if you want to participate, please read and follow the "be nice" code of conduct in the next section.

Found an Issue? Sure, I want to hear about it. The "Issues" on Gitlab is fine. Messages to me are fine too. Gotta pull request? Even better.
