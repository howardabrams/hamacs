My Emacs configuration, that I'm cheekily calling /hamacs/ is a literate programming model heavily inspired by my recent journey into [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKegZI9vWUU][Henrik Lissner's]] [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] and [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]].  I used both extensively, but decided that I would /roll my own/ as Emacs people tend to be /control freaks/ (at least a little bit).

The other advantage to rolling yer own is that you are more likely to /use/ what you add, leading to less bloat, and a more fun experience.

Why yes, feel free to steal whatever you find interesting, as sharing is what makes our community great.  Notice that functions and features that I have written begin with =ha-=, however, everything else is either /stock Emacs/ or a /package/ that I download using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] (see [[file:bootstrap.org][bootstrap]] for how) and configured with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] (see either [[https://ianyepan.github.io/posts/setting-up-use-package/][this introduction]] or [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UsePackage][this wiki page]] for details)... meaning that most blocks of code should /just work/ on its own.
Hit me up with questions, =@howardabrams=.  If you want to try this out, after installing Emacs, and cloning this repo, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./initialize
#+END_SRC
This creates [[file:~/.emacs.d/init.el][~/.emacs.d/init.el]] that starts the process loading the files:

  - [[file:bootstrap.org][bootstrap.org]] :: configures =straight= and loads basic libraries the rest of the code depends on. It then loads the following files in order:
  - [[file:ha-config.org][ha-config.org]] :: contains /most/ of my configuration, setting up my sequence key menus, evil, etc.
  - [[file:ha-display.org][ha-display.org]] :: sets up the visual aspects of an Emacs GUI, including themes, fonts and the dashboard.
  - [[file:ha-org.org][ha-org.org]] :: configures the basics for org-mode formatted files. Specific features, however, come from their own files, however.
  - [[file:ha-org-word-processor.org][ha-org-word-processor.org]] :: attempts to make Org files /visually/ look like what one might see in a word processor, including turning off the colors for headers, and instead increasing their size.
  - [[file:ha-org-clipboard.org][ha-org-clipboard.org]] :: automatically converting HTML from a clipboard into Org-formatted content.
  - [[file:ha-org-journaling.org][ha-org-journaling.org]] :: for writing journal entries and tasks.
  - [[file:ha-org-publishing.org][ha-org-publishing.org]] :: code for publishing my website, [[http://howardism.org][www.howardism.org]].
  - [[file:ha-org-sprint.org][ha-org-sprint.org]] :: functions for working with the my Org-focused sprint files.
  - [[file:ha-remoting.org][ha-remoting.org]] :: my interface to systems using SSH and Vterm.
  - [[file:ha-email.org][ha-email.org]] :: reading email using =notmuch= in a *Hey* fashion.
  - [[file:ha-feed-reader.org][ha-feed-reader.org]] :: configuration of elfeed as well as my RSS feeds.
  - [[file:ha-aux-apps.org][ha-aux-apps.org]] :: optional applications, like Twitter and Telegram.
  - [[file:ha-capturing-notes.org][ha-capturing-notes.org]] :: my engineering notebook.
  - [[file:ha-agendas.org][ha-agendas.org]] :: attempts to "supe-up" my task list.
  - [[file:ha-irc.org][ha-irc.org]] :: connection to IRC servers using rcirc and bitlbee.
  - [[file:ha-passwords.org][ha-passwords.org]] :: code for generating passwords.
  - [[file:ha-programming.org][ha-programming.org]] :: configuration for /all/ programming languages, or at least, the simple ones.
  - [[file:ha-programming-python.org][ha-programming-python.org]] :: configuration for working with Python and LSP.

*Note:* Other functions and files come from essays written on [[http://www.howardism.org][my blog]].  To help with this, see [[file:support/final-initialize.el][support/final-initialize.el]] file.
